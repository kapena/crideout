I am a professional writer and artist who has lived and worked in Portland, Brooklyn and San Diego.  I now live in Honolulu, below Diamond Head, surrounded by subjects for my paintings.  In my art, I seek to capture the immaterial forces— light and wind—that create color, movement, and shape across Hawaiian landscapes.  Working in the medium of watercolor, I craft plein air landscapes that are both precise and lyrical. My figures draw on my exacting technique,  interpretive skills, and playful insights into character. No matter what the subject, my goal is to convey the sense that there is a symbolic fitness in natural forms and that art can awaken our interest in both metaphysics and mystery.
